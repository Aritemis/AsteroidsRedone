# AsteroidsAdventure
This is not the asteroids game I built for my CMPT202 class. That game was pretty boring and not organized very well because we had to do things to their specifications. I got tired of modifying the original code for that assignment, so I decided to make this project. This is a much cooler asteroids game that I decided to do in my downtime just because I enjoy writing programs. I plan to make all game assets myself in photoshop.

It currently stores all data locally and has no online features, but I ever have the resources for an online database I will probably change that.

The finished version will have many features, including but not limited to..
    - Various Instructions
    - Arcade Mode
        - Increases in difficulty with higher levels.   (implemented, but needs new level clear graphics)
        - Has an arcade style high score board.     (partially implemented)
        - Maybe some bonus rounds every so many levels? Like Mappy. Or something like the fruit in Pacman. 
    - Story/Campaign Mode
        - Story. 
        - Time trial?
        - Protect a thing? 
        - Standard clear all asteroids.
    - Endless Asteroids
    - Store (no real money options planned)
        - Different ships. (not available in arcade)
        - Different bullet types. (not available in arcade)
        - Different colors.    (partially implemented)
    - Settings
         - Clear local data.
         - Support for multiple screen sizes.
